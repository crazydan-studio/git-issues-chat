# Git Issues Chat - Design Documentation

## Overview
Git Issues Chat is a desktop application that transforms GitHub repositories into chat rooms, using Issues as topics and Comments as messages. This approach enables real-time collaboration and issue handling through a familiar chat interface.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Golang for core application logic, data management, and GitHub API integration
- **Frontend**: Svelte with Tailwind CSS for the user interface
- **UI Framework**: Go-WebUI for desktop application deployment
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Build System**: Vite for UI bundling

### Core Components

#### 1. Application Core (Golang)
- GitHub API integration for repository, issue, and comment management
- SQLite database for local caching and offline support
- WebUI integration for desktop application deployment
- Command-line interface for configuration and control

#### 2. User Interface (Svelte + Tailwind CSS)
- Chat-style interface for issue discussion
- Repository navigation and issue browsing
- Real-time message updates
- User authentication and preferences

#### 3. Data Flow
```
GitHub API ↔ Application Core ↔ SQLite Database ↔ UI Layer
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Project Foundation (Completed)
- Basic project structure and build system
- Skeleton application with WebUI integration
- Simple welcome UI to verify technical approach
- Implementation of runtime script with proper error handling and help support

### Phase 1: GitHub Integration
- GitHub authentication and API access
- Repository listing and selection
- Issue and comment data retrieval

### Phase 2: Chat Interface Implementation
- Chat-style UI for issues and comments
- Real-time message updates
- Message composition and sending

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Offline support with SQLite caching
- Notification system
- User preferences and settings

### Phase 4: Finalization
- Performance optimization
- Testing and bug fixes
- Documentation and user guides

## Versioning
Application version is maintained in the `VERSION` file and automatically propagated to:
- `src/main.go` for the `--version` flag
- `src/ui/package.json` for UI build identification

## Build Process
The build process is handled by `build/build.sh` which:
1. Cleans previous build artifacts
2. Updates version information
3. Builds the Svelte UI with Tailwind CSS
4. Compiles the Golang application in both release and debug modes
5. Copies `build/bin/chat.sh` to `dist/chat.sh`

## Runtime Script
The application is run using `dist/chat.sh` which:
- Supports `--debug` flag to run debug version
- Accepts `--browser` parameter (default: firefox)
- Provides `--help` for usage information
- Automatically creates data directory if needed
- Performs comprehensive permission checks
- Uses paths relative to its own location for portability

## Runtime Requirements
- Supported browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Edge
- Environment variable: `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` (for WebKit compatibility)
- Required directories: data storage and UI assets

## Technical Notes

### Tailwind CSS Font Size Handling
Due to Tailwind CSS v4's content-based purging, predefined font size classes may not be included in the build. For reliable font size control, arbitrary value notation (e.g., `text-[72px]`) is used instead of predefined classes (e.g., `text-8xl`).

### Data Directory Management
The application no longer automatically creates the data directory. This responsibility has been moved to the runtime script, which automatically creates the data directory if it doesn't exist, providing better separation of concerns.
